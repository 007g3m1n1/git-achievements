Enjoy using Git and unlock achievements for doing actions

There are over 20 achievement, many with different levels to be achieved.
After a git command is executed if a new achievement is unlocked
a message will appear on your console like this:

********************************************************************************
                            Git Achievement Unlocked!                            

                                Miller (Level 1)                                
                      Add only part of a file to the stage.                      
********************************************************************************

A log of all of your achievements is kept locally, but you can also publish
it to GitHub.  

For example here is mine: http://icefox.github.com/git-achievements

To push to GitHub first fork the project on GitHub, clone *your* repository
and set the following config:

git config --global achievement.upload "true"

When an achievement is unlocked the index.html file will be overwritten,
committed and then a git push origin will be executed.

Install
-------
Add git-achievements to your path and alias git to git-achievements

For example add the following to the end of your ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=$PATH:~/git/git-achievements
alias git='git-achievements'
